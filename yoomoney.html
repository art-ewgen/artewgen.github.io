        <p>
          During my work, I redesigned projects such as the Embedded checkout form (Widget), Redirect form and Mobile SDK. Also, I created design for YooKassa managment app for business.
      </p>
      <h3 class="content__h3">Responsibilities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>conducting user researches: interviews and usability testings;</li>
        <li>taking an active role in the sprints planning for the front-end team for effective production of services and using scrum methodology;</li>
        <li>developing a design system;</li>

      <img class="content__pic" alt="Checkout widget redesign prototype" src="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-proto.png">
      <p>
        <a class="link link--inline" target="_blank" href="https://yookassa.ru/widget/">YooMoney widget</a> 
        is the company's latest payment acceptance solution. It's a ready-made form for websites that provides seamless payments without switching to other tabs. The widget is used by Adidas & Reebok, iHerb, Renault and other big names.
      </p>
      <h3 class="content__h3">Problems. Quality user testing</h3>
      <img class="content__pic" alt="Quality user testing reviews" src="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-reviews.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-reviews@2x.png 2x">
      <p>
        Series of accumulated requests from businesses and users served as the incentive for the redesign. In the beginning, business requirements were collected:  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>improve conversion rate;</li>
        <li>add new payment methods as SberPay and linked cards;</li>
        <li>add the ability to brand the appearance;</li>
        <li>improve scalability and add re-select payment methods.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        User testing helped to identify the main UX design problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>improve highlighting of the selected method;</li>
        <li>fix the location of the payment button;</li>
        <li>make it easier to fill out a bank card details.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="content__h3">Quantitative user testing</h3>

      <p>
        The heatmap confirmed the concerns users expressed in their interviews. For instance, some of the users failed to understand which payment method was active and where they should click to commit the payment.
      </p>
      <h3 class="content__h3">New concepts</h3>
      <img class="content__pic" alt="New concepts" src="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-concept.png">
      <p>
        To cover all of the widget redesign goals, three prototypes were made. Each of them was quantitatively tested, compared to the old design. The best version was selected as the final one.
      </p>
    

        <h3 class="content__h3">Redesign results</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>major product and UX issues are closed;</li>
          <li>conversion rate increased more than 5%;</li>
          <li>new features: loyalty, scalability, re-election etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional goal — the concept of the widget was re-used in more than 8 company projects.</p>
        <h3 class="content__h3">Real widget examples</h3>
        <p>
          More than thousand of merchants integrate the widget to their websites — from little stores to multi-million services.

      <p>Users of the YooKassa did not have the opportunity to monitor the statistics of their sites on mobile devices, because the site with the personal account of YooKassa does not have an adaptive version.

      <p>First version of mSDK was made more than 5 years ago and hasn’t chance since that time. During this time, a lot of requests from businesses have accumulated and obvious problems in UX have been noticeable.</p>
      <p>In the process of research, users were surveyed about the current version, collecting product needs and technical limitations from developers. The research results were analyzed, problems were identified and the following goals for improvement were identified:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>cimprove the card payment method;</li>

      <p>
        Prototypes are assembled, tested, modified, and re-tested to a successful version. Visual design was created based on the design system.
